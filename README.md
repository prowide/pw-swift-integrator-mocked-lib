# PW Swift Integrator Mocked-lib

In this library the classes and methods are mocked and the only propose is to show how to integrate the library with the PW Swift SDK.
This library is useless for any other propose.
When you integrate your Mule Connector with the PW Swift SDK, you will need to add the jar files in your AnyPoint Idea project to be able to run the application with the 
real classes and methods.
